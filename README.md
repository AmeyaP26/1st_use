# Blood Glucose Level Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an in-depth analysis of my personal blood glucose levels over the past year, accounting for 1062 tests. The primary objective is to uncover patterns, identify factors influencing blood glucose variability, and gain insights into better managing blood glucose levels.

## Data Description
- **Data Source**: Personal blood glucose meter records.
- **Time Frame**: 12 months (Year 2023 - 2024).
- **Number of Tests**: 1062 measurements.
- **Attributes**:
  - **Date**: Date of each blood glucose reading.
  - **Time**: Time of each blood glucose reading.
  - **Blood Glucose Level**: Measured in mg/dL.
  - **Notes**: Extra comments provided for a particular reading
  - **Range**: Was the glucose level in-range / out of range etc.
  - **Type of glucose levels**: Whether the test was pre-meal or post-meal.

## Objectives
1. **Trend Analysis**: Identify trends and patterns in blood glucose levels over time.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Determine how factors such as meals, physical activity, and medication influence blood glucose levels.
3. **Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia Analysis**: Examine occurrences of low and high blood sugar levels and potential triggers.
4. **Statistical Summary**: Provide a comprehensive statistical overview of blood glucose levels.

## Methodology
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to identify trends, distributions, and correlations.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Analyzing trends over time and seasonal patterns.
- **Correlation and Regression Analysis**: Investigating relationships between different variables and their impact on blood glucose levels.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and reporting.

## Key Insights
- **Trends**: Insights into how blood glucose levels have varied over the year.
- **Influencing Factors**: Analysis of how meals affect blood glucose levels.
- **Recommendations**: Strategies for better blood glucose management based on analysis.

## Future Work
- **Modeling**: Developing more sophisticated models to predict blood glucose levels and HbA1c levels.
- **Integration**: Linking this analysis with real-time monitoring tools or applications.

## Conclusion
This project aims to provide valuable insights into blood glucose management through detailed data analysis. The findings could be crucial for improving daily glucose control and overall health management.
